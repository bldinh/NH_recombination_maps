# Recombination Maps
This repository is dedicated to hosting recombination maps made for the Native Hawaiians as part of an ongoing effort to produce genomic resources for underserved populations.

Maps are pre-formatted to be compatible for use with the Eagle phasing software.

Due to the impact of low SNP density on inferred recombination rates, a mask is also provided indicating areas of low confidence (SNP density falling below a threshold of 15 SNPs per 500kb window including the centromeres).
